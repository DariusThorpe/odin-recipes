    <p>A lovely, creamy risotto is perfect as a side dish, but it can easily be served as a main course meal. It is simple to make, and while you may need to tend to it over the stove, it is a worthwile endeavour.</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp Salt plus some to taste</li>
        <li>6 tbsp Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups White Onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups Arborio Rice</li>
        <li>1 cup Dry White Wine</li>
        <li>5 tbsp Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups Finely Grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Preparation</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Combine <b>1 tbsp salt</b> and 10 cups of water in a medium pot. Bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium heat and let it simmer.</p>

        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Heat <b>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</b> in a large pot. Cook 1/2 <b>finely chopped large white onion</b> and a <b>pinch of salt</b>, stirring frequently, until the onion is transluscent and starting to soften. Add 1/2 cup water and cook, stirring often, until the water evaporates and the onion is sizzling in oil and completely tender. Taste the onion, if it is still firm, add another splash of water and continue cooking until meltingly soft.</p>
        <p><i>Adding the water allows the onion to cook gently and thoroughly without taking on any colour.</i></p> 
        
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Add <b>2 cups Arborio Rice</b> to cooked onions and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains of rice are transluscent around the edges and they make a glassy clattering sound when they hit the sides and bottom of the pot. Coating the grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the oitsude does not become mushy before the center is tender. Add <b>1 cup dry white wine</b> and another <b>pinch of salt</b>. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is completely evaporated.</p>

        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water tro rice in 3/4 cup incrememnts, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and surrounded by fluid in a not too thick creamy suspension. It should take 2 - 3 minutes for each addittion addition to be absorbed. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are the keys to cooking risotto, encouraging the starches to release from the rice and transforming into the dish's trademark creamy consistency. It is best to err on the side of soup, than sludge, when judging the amount of water to add.</p>

        <p>Check the rice after 15 minutes to test if the rice is tender, not mushy with a slightly firm center that doesn't leave a chalky or bitter residue between your teeth after tasting.</p>

        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Remove pot from heat, add <b>5 tbsp unsalted butter</b> and stir until melted. Gradually add <b>1 3/4 cup Parmesan</b>, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid surrounding risotto is creamy but very fluid. Stir in more hot salted water if needed to achieve the right consistency. Taste and season with salt.</p>

        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Divide risotto among warm bowls. Top each with a grind of pepper. Serve with remaining <b>1/2 cup Parmesan</b> alongside for passing.</p>
